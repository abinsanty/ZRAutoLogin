# Zebra Robotics Auto Login

## Description
I made this project in order to minimize the time spent logging into the Zebra Robotics portal. Other coaches and I use the portal for marking attendance, finding student ID numbers, and marking weekly timesheets.

I also wanted to automate a few tasks within Canvas. We use Canvas to host the curriculum, as well as grade student submissions. Canvas is critical to both coaches and students, and automating some of our processes would save a lot of time.

## Goals
1. Automatically log into Canvas and the Zebra Robotics Portal
2. Mark attendance
3. Grade students

### Technologies Used
Python, Selenium
