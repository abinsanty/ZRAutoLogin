# Zebra Robotics Auto Login

## Description
I made this project in order to minimize the time spent logging into the Zebra Robotics portal. Other coaches and I use the portal for marking attendance, finding student ID numbers, and marking weekly timesheets.

We use Canvas to host the curriculum, as well as grade student submissions. Grading assignments has always been tedious for coaches, as it requires us to navigate to the correct class, open the gradebook, search for a student's number, scroll over to their assignment, and manually enter their grade.

This doesn't sound too bad, but there's a million ways to mess up while doing this.
1. It can be hard to tell what a specific class actually is, making it easy to click on the wrong one.
   - A good example is the Robot Design and Navigation class, or R400, for short. This class has multiple levels (Beginner, Intermediate, and Advanced), as well as a second iteration, labeled "2.0". Each class is named "R400 Spike: Robot Design and Navigation (LEVEL) VERSION", where "LEVEL" and "VERSION" are replaced with their respective values. However, Canvas uses ellipses to shorten the name when there isn't enough room to fully display it. This leads to identical courses, all labeled "R400 Spike: Robot Design and Nav...".
2. Finding a specific student requires a coach to search for their name, 
3. Each class has 20+ challenges, making it difficult to find specific grades quickly.
